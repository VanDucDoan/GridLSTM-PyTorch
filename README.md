Grid LSTM PyTorch
=================

**DISCLAIMER:** *This repo is untested and needs further work before it can be considered correct. I was planning on using the GridLSTM for my research, but as research usually goes, I ended up going a different direction. If you would like to contribute, feel free to file issues and/or make a pull request. I should have more time to further test this repo this summer.*

A basic [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/)
implementation of the Grid LSTM network
described in
[Kalchbrenner et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.01526.pdf).
